## Automated Home System

This project implements a remotely operable smart home system, designed, simulated, and prototyped using a Raspberry Pi, Flask, and Proteus Design Suite.

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an automated home system, allowing remote control and monitoring of various home appliances and sensors. The system was initially designed and simulated within the Proteus Design Suite environment before being deployed on a Raspberry Pi.

## Key Features

*   **Remote Control:** Control home appliances (e.g., lights, fans) remotely via a web interface.
*   **Web Interface:** User-friendly web interface built with Flask for easy interaction and control.
*   **Simulation and Prototyping:** Designed and simulated in Proteus Design Suite using components like Compim and Virtual Serial Port Emulator.
*   **Raspberry Pi Deployment:** Deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-world application.

## Technologies Used

*   **Raspberry Pi:** The main processing unit for the smart home system.
*   **Flask (Python):** Web framework used to create the web interface and handle communication between the Raspberry Pi and the user.
*   **Proteus Design Suite:** Software used for circuit design, simulation, and prototyping.
*   **Compim (Proteus):** Component used for simulating communication interfaces.
*   **Virtual Serial Port Emulator:** Tool used for simulating serial communication between virtual devices in Proteus.

## Project Workflow

1.  **Design and Simulation (Proteus):** The smart home circuit was designed and simulated in Proteus Design Suite, utilizing Compim for communication simulation and a Virtual Serial Port Emulator for virtual serial communication.
2.  **Web Interface Development (Flask):** A web interface was developed using Flask to provide remote control and monitoring capabilities.
3.  **Raspberry Pi Deployment:** The Flask application was deployed on a Raspberry Pi, enabling real-world implementation of the smart home system.
4.  **Communication:** The Raspberry Pi communicates with the simulated hardware to control appliances and read sensor data.

## Setting Up (For Simulation)

1.  Install Proteus Design Suite.
2.  Open the project file within Proteus.
3.  Configure the Virtual Serial Port Emulator to create a virtual serial port.
4.  Run the simulation in Proteus.
5.  Run the Flask application on your local machine, configuring it to communicate with the virtual serial port.

## Setting Up (For Raspberry Pi Deployment)

1.  Install Flask on your Raspberry Pi: `sudo apt-get install python3-flask`
2.  Copy the Flask application code to your Raspberry Pi.
3.  Connect the necessary hardware components (sensors, relays, etc.) to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.
4.  Configure the Flask application to communicate with the hardware via the appropriate GPIO pins or communication protocols (e.g., serial, I2C, SPI).
5.  Run the Flask application on the Raspberry Pi.

## Usage

Once the system is running (either in simulation or on the Raspberry Pi), you can access the web interface through a web browser to control appliances and monitor sensor data.

## Future Enhancements

*   Implement more advanced features like automation rules and scheduling.
*   Integrate with other smart home platforms or services.
*   Improve the user interface and add more visualization options.
*   Implement security features to protect the system from unauthorized access.
